### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel "Squid" from Oklahoma. I am a Business Operations Specialist and concert photographer. I'm on a journey to transition into the world of IT, with a focus on cybersecurity, software development, and networking. My fascination with technology goes back to the days of using HTML on MySpace, taking apart robot dogs to understand how they functioned, and believing the computer was magic with all it could do.

Recently, I've been immersing myself in the world of IT by studying for CompTIA's Security+ and working through Google's Cyber Security Course. I look forward to learning more about properly defending work systems in my studies and at work.

Outside the world of IT, you can often find me behind the camera, capturing the energy and moments of live music. I'm eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, learn from one another, and explore the evolving landscape of technology. If you're interested in collaborating, sharing insights, or just having a tech chat, feel free to reach out!
